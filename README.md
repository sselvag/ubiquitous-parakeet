# Tech Blog
  
## As a developer who writes about tech, I want a CMS-style blog site so that I can publish articles, blogposts, and my thoughts and opinions. In this project, I need to create a Tech Blog that satisfies the following criteria: 
  1. When I visit the site for the first time, then I should be presented with the homepage, which includes existing blog posts if any have been posted; navigation links for the homepage and the dashboard; and the option to log in.
  2. When I click on the homepage option, then I should be taken to the homepage.
  3. When I click on any other links in the navigation, then I should be prompted to either sign up or sign in.
  4. When I choose to sign up, then I should be prompted to create a username and password.
  5. When I click on the sign-up button, then my user credentials should be saved and I am logged into the site.
  6. When I revisit the site at a later time and choose to sign in, then I should be prompted to enter my username and password.
  7. When I am signed in to the site, then I should see navigation links for the homepage, the dashboard, and the option to log out.
  8. When I click on the homepage option in the navigation, then I should be taken to the homepage and presented with existing blog posts that include the post title and the date created.
