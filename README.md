# Tech Blog
  
## As a developer who writes about tech, I want a CMS-style blog site so that I can publish articles, blogposts, and my thoughts and opinions. In this project, I need to create a Tech Blog that satisfies the following criteria: 
  1. When I visit the site for the first time, then I should be presented with the homepage, which includes existing blog posts if any have been posted; navigation links for the homepage and the dashboard; and the option to log in.
  2. When I click on the homepage option, then I should be taken to the homepage.
  3. When I click on any other links in the navigation, then I should be prompted to either sign up or sign in.
  4. When I choose to sign up, then I should be prompted to create a username and password.
  5. When I click on the sign-up button, then my user credentials should be saved and I am logged into the site.
  6. When I revisit the site at a later time and choose to sign in, then I should be prompted to enter my username and password.
  7. When I am signed in to the site, then I should see navigation links for the homepage, the dashboard, and the option to log out.
  8. When I click on the homepage option in the navigation, then I should be taken to the homepage and presented with existing blog posts that include the post title and the date created.
  9. When I click on an existing blog post, then I should be presented with the post title, contents, post creator’s username, and date created for that post and have the option to leave a comment.
  10. When I enter a comment and click on the submit button while signed in, then the comment should save and the post is updated to display the comment, the comment creator’s username, and the date created.
  11. When I click on the dashboard option in the navigation, then I should be taken to the dashboard and be presented with any blog posts I have already created and the option to add a new blog post.
  12. When I click on the button to add a new blog post, then I should be prompted to enter both a title and contents for my blog post.
  13. When I click on the button to create a new blog post, then the title and contents of my post should be saved and I should be taken back to an updated dashboard with my new blog post.
  14. When I click on one of my existing posts in the dashboard, then I should be able to delete or update my post and be taken back to an updated dashboard.
  15. When I click on the logout option in the navigation, then I should be signed out of the site.
  16. When I am idle on the site for more than a set time, then I should be able to view comments but I am prompted to log in again before I can add, update, or delete comments.
